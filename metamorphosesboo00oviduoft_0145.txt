rejoices that she is not with him. He would wish, too, to
look back to the shores of his native land, and to turn his
last look towards home 3 but where it is he knows not : the
sea boils with so mighty a whirling eddy, and the whole
sky lies hidden beneath a shadow drawn on from pitchy
clouds, and the picture of night is doubled in darkness.

551. The mast is broken by the rush of the whirlwind of
rain ; the rudder, too, is broken, and standing over its spoils
the wave, as if a conqueror, undannted and swollen in 8111ν83,

no less weight than if one were to tear up the whole of
Athos and Pindus from their foundation and overthrow
