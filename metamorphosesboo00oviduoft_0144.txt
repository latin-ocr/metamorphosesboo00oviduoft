stretched out before them, so when the winds had risen and
the waters had entered, they advanced against and were
much higher than the rigging of the ship. And now the
bolts totter, and, deprived of their covering of wax, the
,chinks open wide, and offer a path to the deadly waves.
Lo, the clouds discharge themselves, and heavy showers
fall, and you would think that the whole of heaven was
descensling into the sea, and that the swelling ocean was
ascending to the region of heaven. The sails are wet with
the rain—cloud<, and the waves of the sea are mingled in
confusion with the waters from heaven. The sky is with-
out its fires, and dark night is overcast both with its own
gloom and that of the storm. Yet the gleaming lightning

brother and parent, to another his home with its pledges of
affection, and whatever is left to him. The thought of
