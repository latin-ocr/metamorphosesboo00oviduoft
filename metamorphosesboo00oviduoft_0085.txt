582. hoc: this latter, i.e.‚ that he should prefer no other woman to
her. Hic generally refers to the nearer of two objects
(the latter), and ille to the one farther off (the former).

584. manus funestas: unclean hands. Contact or connection with
a dead body, or having a dead body in the house, was con·
sidered to defile a person. So in this case, by a poetical
