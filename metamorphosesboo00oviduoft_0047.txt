The enclitic que = and is short, but in this book we
have two instances in which it is lengthened :

(1) Sarculaque rastrique graves longique ligones.
(2) Peleusque comitesque rogant, quibus ille profatur.

b Tlllere are two remarkable instanoes of hiatus in this
00 ε

(1) T5mp5n51qu’ et plautsus Η etl Bacchelz maillfitlfi?
(2) orgia} madidegrfit ΙΙ cum} Cecrop'ilb E—ulmolssi') 93)
In addition to the hiatus, the former of these} line)s is

noticeable because it ends with a word of four syllables,

and the latter line is noticeable because it has a spondee
in the fifth foot.

In line 456 we have both these irregularities combined:
aptadique sii is ΙΙ pinffim jubet} arma!mentis.
The text used is that of Trflbner, and the present editor

is deeply indebted to the excellent editions of Haupt and
Siebolis. Ll. 221-265 and 303-317 have been omitted.
