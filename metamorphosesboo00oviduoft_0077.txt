sparsus, and another is—
“ Belua vasta, lupus mucisque palustribus exit
Oblitus et spumis, expersus sanguine rictus,'’ etc.

muhcus prgbably means moisture‚ but it. is an uncommon use of
t e wor .

oblitus: from oblivio, to besmear3 cf. line 136.

rictus fulmineos is the acc. of respect, governed by sparsus or
exspersus, if those words are in the reading. If spisso is read,
rictus is acc. of respect, governed by oblitus.

but see line 718, infra. Quamvis may be used to qualisy an

adj.‚ anmnqucun cannot bc so used. Thus, “ however great. ”=
quamvis maynus, not quamquam maqnuS.

defensamus: t‘lejenso is the. frequentative form of defendo, and

prose when cum is used with quibus, it is placed after the
relative,—quibnscum‚ not, cum- quibus. So mecum, tecum,
secum, nobiscum, vobiscum, quocum.

excita: from ereio, -ἱι-ι· or -ii, -itmn, 4, to ronse, terrify.

capillos : acc. of respect.

infusa has a middle sense rather than a passive = ponring
herself round, i.e., clinging to, from infundo, -Ῑιιιῖί, -susum, 3.
