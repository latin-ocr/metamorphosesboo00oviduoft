10 ovm's METAMORPHOSES.

With regard to rules for the quantity of syllables, the
following are the most important, but they are nearly all
' subject to exeeptions :—

(l) A diphthong or contracted syllable is long, e.g.‚
ααοερε, co‘yit (=05d92't).

(2) The former of two vowels not forming a diphthong
is short, e.g., gyrat-ius.

(3) A vowel is long when it is followed (1) by two
consonants or x or z, whether in the same word or
different words ; or (2) by a j in the same word.

(4) A vowel by nature short becomes either long or
short when it eomes before a mute followed by a liquid,

e.g.‚ tenebrae,- but 9η and qm make a preceding vowel long.

(5) Final syllables of words ending in a, i, ο, α, αδ, εδ,
os, and c are long.

(6) Final syllables of words ending in e, n, r, Ζ, d, t,
is, us, and ys are short.

(7) Monosyllables are generally long.

(8) Final a in nom. and aco. is short.

Final is is long in dat. and abl. plurals² in 2nd sing.
pres. of verbs of the 4th conj-ugation.

Final us is short except in the nom. and aec. pl„
and gen. sing. of the 4th declension‚ and in fem.
nouus like virtus.

A vowel at the end of a word is elided before a. vowel at
the beginning of the next word.

The syllables am, em, im, om, and um at the end of a.
word are elided before a vowel at the beginning of the
next word.

The letter h has no effect as a consonant in Iengthening
a preceding· vowel. A final vowel is elided before a word
beginning with h, thus atque hos.

lt is unusual to have a word of more than three syllables
at the end of a line; the last word of a line generally
cons <ists of either tuo or thiee syllables. A monosyllable
at the end of a line, e. g., ri1 Ιιειιῖι ns mus, vulnificus sus, is
no ot reckoned elegant, bnt this renim k il« (sm not apply to
a line en ling rein st 1 recede l by ιι xx ord which could itself
have ended the line, e. .‚g. ᾶεῖδᾶ l’st, cr( ‹itci ἑ t.
