Branch lv. -The fii st stage compris es 30 paper s in each 1anguage;
the second stage 15 longer papers in each.

The plan followed in the English section naturally differs ver3·
materiall3 from the one pursued m F1ench or German.

In English, greaterstress is laid· m the 30 papers of the first stage on
language than on literature, because that part of the subject demDands
more specifie. knowledge and more soientific methods. Language (in-
cluding A. S. E. and M. E.) therefore, appropriatos otwo- thirds of the
papers‚ the remainder being devoted τ.) literature. ln the second
stage, on the other hand, the papers are about equall3 divided betwceu
the two parts of the subject. In the whole English course, attention
is not squandered on minor names that would only be of nnportanee' in
a special period (the range of the exam. is too wide for such ti eatment);
but the most prominent writers of each epoeh are selected for special
study of themselves, their works, and the times in which they lived.

In a foreign langnuge, say French, the lines of the M .A. examination
are closeli' followed iu every one of the 45 papers, that is to say, each
paper contains. -(1)* Translation into English, including Idioms
(lst paper at M. A. ), ( 2) Modern Grammar (lst paper at Μ. A. ), (3) Old
French (2nd paper at M A. ), (4) Historical Grammar (2nd paper at
M. A.,) (5) Retranslati0n‚ including Idioms (3rd p iptr at M. A. )‚ (⁴5)
Hister) of French Literatuie (4th paper at M. A. )‚ (7 ) Original Com-
position in French (4th paper at M. A. ). Each of these seven sections
is g'raduated m difficulty throughout the whole course, and here, as in
English, the most diffieult portions of the subject (e. (7. the cham-021 de
Roland' ιιι Old French) are reserv ed for the second stage. As an in-
stance of the thoroughness with which the course is plannech it ma)
be mentioned that m the whole F rench course 480 French idioms and
480 English idioms are given for translation..

Each test· -paper is aceompanied by a paper containing notes. hints
suggestions, and the advice of a specialist on the reading for the next*
