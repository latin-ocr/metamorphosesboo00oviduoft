who do not wish to have complete preparation in au the branches of a
subject, (2) for those who cannot join till late, χ3) to serve as a Reca-
pitulation. With the exception of Latin Prose, they are included in
the special and Ordinary Courses. Students wishing to join for them
before the time stated, may in some cases do so.

Special Arrangements for Greek and Ptench.

As both these subjecte are required at luter„ and only one at Matric.‚
alternative Intermediate Com-ses have been arranged, one of which
assumes only a knowledge up to the regular verb. Students who
have not this elementary knowledge in the second language may
either take a Preliminary Course in it (separate1y, at a* fee. of one
guinea, or together with the longer Inter. Course, for 133. 13³. 6d.) ; or
if he is desii-ons of acquiring this prelimiuary knowledge without
systematic tuition, on receipt of his Form of Entryin advance for the
Ordinary Intermediate Course, advice as to the best books and course
of private stud3⁷ will be given at the outset, and occasional aid ren-
dered, without a special see.

January Matriculants are strongly advised to work up as soon as
possible the language not taken at Matric. to the standard which
they must attain before joining the Inter. Arts Classes: and to com-
mence s3 stematic work for the next Examination by Easter if pos-

sible. Thus, by paying due attention to all subjecte, they will bs·
making steid’y and satisfactory progress.

Students who pass in June may, by ooncentrating their energies
on the second lang-lage. get through the preliminary work required
in time to join the September section of the Inter. Arts Class.
Arrangernems are made for Students to work the Pi eliminar3 Courses
without interruption during the summer vacation.
