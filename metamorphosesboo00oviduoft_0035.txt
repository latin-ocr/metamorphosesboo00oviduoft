NOTE.

As Correspondenee students are generally children of an older
growth, they do not care to have their names blazed abroad as pupils,
and we therefore refrain from publishing a list of references and
reprinting testimonials‚ of which we have hundreds of the most
laudatory kind. Many successful students have, nemrtheless, been so
kind as to offer to answer any questions with regard to the College
which intending correspondents may care to put, and references to ’
these will be given to any who really wish for thern.

We, morem-er, rest our claims to the student‘ s confid nce orrthe com-
parison which he ean make for himself between our reprints of the Pass
Lists and those issued by the University; αφ, the last Intermediate
Axts and Matriculation Lists‚ in each of which he will find the names
01* more than seventy University Correspondence College studente,
and the B.A.‚ where over 15 per cent. of the whole list belong to us.

At the Matriculation Examination of January, 1889, all other
Correspondence Classes together show only one success on the

University List. ἢ]
