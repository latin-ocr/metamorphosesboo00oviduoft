'two Years' Gom-se for niter. Arte.

Although we do not recommend the average student to take two
years in preparation for Inter. Arts, still them are some studente
whose time is so ver) limited that it is impossible to prepare in one
year. We haime therefore, made arrangements for studente to die-
tribute their work over more than a x ear. We prefer them to begin
the last week ιιι either September, Januar), or April, on which latter
date we etronol) recommcnd those who have recentli matriculated to
commoneo work. The feo for students joining in tho Michaelmns
Term ieinereased by one guium, and for those beginning in the Lent
Term by hnlf-a-guinen, to compensato for the extra postage and the
longe-r time th«— papers uro in une. In order to encourage January
Matrioulants to avoid ruistiug, and to work up during the term th<-
language not talu-n at Matriculatiom no extra feo is made for students
eommeneing after Easter.
