last days of Troy. This man was the brother of Hector,
and unless he had experienced a strange fate in the
beginning of his youth, perchance he would have had a
name no less high than that of Hector, although the
daughter of D3mas bore the latter. Alexirrhoe‚ the child
of do ible-horned Granicus, is said to have given birth to
AEsacus secre ly beneath shady Ida. He hated cities, and,
