2 ovm’s METAMORPHOSES, xi.

the morrow's saud of the amphitheatre is the prey of dogs,
so they attack the bard again, and cast at him their green-
leaved thyrsi, not made for this purpose. Some hurl clods
of earth, others branches plucked from a tree; some hurl
flint—stones. And, lest weapons should fail their madness,
some oxen by chance were turning up the earth with down—
pressed ploughshare: and, not far hence, preparing their
reward by abundanee of toil, some brawny countrymeu
were digging up the hard giound. They fiee at the sight

with their own tears. The Naiads and Dryads had their
garments black in mourning, and kept their hair dishevelled.
His limbs lie scattered in different places. Thou, O Hebrus
receivest his head and lyre ; and (inarvellous to relate)
while it glides down in mid-stream, the lyre emits some
mournful plaintixo note, and the liseless tongue some
mournful murmur: the banks give a inournful answering
echo. And now, carried out to sea, they (the head and
lyre) leave their native river, and take possession of the
shore of Methymnaeau Lesbos. Here a fierce serpent
attacks his face landel 011 a foreign shore, and his locks
