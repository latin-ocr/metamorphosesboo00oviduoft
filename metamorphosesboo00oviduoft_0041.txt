6. Fassuram Libri XII„ of which only the first six
remain. This work was incomplete at the time of the
poet's banishment, ΑΛ). 8, and he must have done the
greatest part of it at Tomi. It is probable that he began
writing this patriotic work in order to recommend himself
to the Emperor, who might make him the court-poet now
that Horace and Vergil were dead. His banishment,
however, put an end to any hopes he might have enter-
tained in that direction.

7. Tristium Libri V., five books of elegies written
during the first four years of his banishment, describing
his misery‚ and entreating Augustus for mercy.

In addition to these, Ovid wrotea tragedy called Medea,
which by his contemporaries was reckoned his greatest

and a satire, Ibis.

both her and Ovid, whose evil counscls, in his opinion, had
caused her and also her mother Julia (the Emperor’s
daughter) to go astray. Whatever may have been the
reason, the fact remains that towards the end of the year

Tomi, a town on the Euxine, near the mouth of the
Danube, at the extreme limit of the empire. This banish-
ment was not, however, an exsilium, but a relevatio, the
latter being milder than the former; by a releqatz'o he
neither lost his citizenship nor deprived himself of
all hope of return. To ovid, with his town-bred tastes
and requirements, this releyatio was a most severe punish-
