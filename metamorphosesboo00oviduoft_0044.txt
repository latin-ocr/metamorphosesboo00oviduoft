sea-monster. A reward is offered for her rescue; Hercules
delivers her, but Laomedon again fails to redeem his
plighted word. Hercules accordingly plunders Troy, and
carries off Hesione, the daughter of Laomedon (11. 194-
220).

(4) Fable of Peleus and Ceyx (ll. 265—410). Jupiter
becomes alarmed at the prophecy that Thetis will be the
mother of a child who is to be greater than his father3
he accordingly allows Peleus to be her husband, instead
of assuming that position himself. The offspring of the.
marriage is Achilles. Peleus has had the misfortune to
kill his brother Phocus, and accordingly goes to Ceyx of
Trachis in order to be purified. He there learns that
Daedalion, the brother of CeyX, has been changed into a
hawk‚ and also that a wolf which has been sent by
Psamatbe to revenge Phocus is destroying the herds.
Thetis intercedes on behalt' of Peleus, and the Nereid
Psamathe turns the wolf into stoue.

(5) Fable of Ceyx aud Alcyone. Ceyx is shipwrecked
011 his voyage to the oracle of Apollo at Claros, whither
he had gone to consult about his brother’s fate. His body
is cast up on the shore ot' his own country, aud is there
discovered by his wife Alcyone, who had had a dream,
sent by Somnus at Juno’s command, which revealed to
her the fate of her husband. In despair at this confirma-
tion of her dream, she casts herself into the sea; but the
gods, 111 pity, change both her and her husband into king-
fishers (ll. 410—748).

(6) Fable of Aesacus. The transformation of Ceyx
and Alcyone into birds reminds the poet of another similar
transforniation. Aesacus, the son of Priam and Alexim-hoe,
is in love with aud pursues Hesperie, the daughter of the
river-god Cebren. In endeavouring to escape she is bitten
by a serpent, aud dies from the wound. Aesacus, through
grief at her destruction, plunges into the sea, and is
changed by Tethys into a bird called the diver.
