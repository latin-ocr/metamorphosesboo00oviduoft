mast, and catch the breezes as they come. Either less than
a nalf, or, at any rate, a half and no more of the sea had
been cut through by the ship‚ and the land on both sides
was sar off, when the sea at the fall of night began to whiten
with swelling waves‚ and the stormy east wind to blow
more violently. The helmsman eries: “ Let down at once
uhe topsaiIS, and furl the whole canvas on the yards.'' He
gives his commands, but the hostile winds hinder their per-
formance, nor does the dashing of the waters allow any
words to be heard. Still of their own accord some hasten
to draw in the oarS‚ some to secure the sides of the ship,

of a high mountain it seems to look down into the valleys
and depths of Acheron; now when it has sunk and the
encircling waters have surrounded it, it seems to look up to
zhe top of heaven from its low abyss. With wave-struck
side often it gives 3 mighty crash, and battered by the sea
