she beholds it, the less and less does she keep her senses.
And now it is moved up close to the land near at hand, and
now she sees it so as to be able to recognise it--it was her

tearing her sace, hair, and clothes, and, stretching forth her
trembling hands to Ceyx, she says : “Is it thus, O dearest

too, whom you see cleaving the sea with small legs is the
offspring of a king3 and if you seek to go down in a con-

old Laomedon, and l'riam, whose lot it was to rule over the
