the heroines of mythology to their faithless husbands.

3. Ars Amatoria, or De Arte Amandi, written about
Rc. 2, when he was more than forty years old. The first
two books of the Ars Amatoria are supposed to instruct
men, and the last book women. When Ovid was banished

of love.

time of Augustus, the last transformation described being
