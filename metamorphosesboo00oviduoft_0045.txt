ς 3. METRE.

The metre of this poem is the ordinary hexameter
as used by Vergil. Each line consists of six seem
each foot is either a spondee or a dactyl. A spondee
consists of two long syllables, αξη, ρὲηιῖἑηΐ. Α dactyl
consists of one long syllable followed by two short
syllableS‚e.g.o'sculi1‘.

The fifth foot' in a line is always a dactyL and the last
foot a s;p0ndee or, to speak more accurately‚ the last foot
consists of two syllables, the former of which 1s always
long and the latter either long or short.

dagob? first four feet of the line can be either spondees or
s.

The fifth foot is occasionally‚ though very rarely, a
spondee. There is an instance in Ovid, Met. XI.⁷ l. 93:

orgia] tradIde Ι rat ΙΙ αὐτη Ι Cecropi ἰ ὀ Eu l molpo
and another in l. 456.

A caesura is a cutting up of a foot by the termination of
a word before the last syllable of the foot. Usually the
caesura falls in the third foot, after the first syllable ; but
it can fall after the second syllable of a dactyI, and it oc-
casionally occurs in the fourth foot instead of the third.

An inst‘tnce of a caesura falling after the first syllable
of the third foot (the usual caesura, and called sironq
caesura) is given above.

An instance of a caesura falling after the second syl-
lable of a dactylic third foot (called a wealc caesura) is

An instance of the caesura in the fourth foot is
