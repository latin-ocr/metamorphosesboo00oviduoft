The Sohoozmaster, of May met, 1887, says 2-“This series oi
Gnidon to the Examjnations of London University will prove extremely
servioeable to candidates. They arbas Guides should be—oon-
fessedly limited in scope, but they give just the kind of dix-oetion md
advice that a student neede, pointing out the most reliable, helphL
and recent sources of information, and plainly iudicating points of
special importance. In the Mathematical Guides for Matrxculafion
and the Imm-mediate, the syllabus is divided up into weekly or {ort-
nightly portions, and all the handbooks give sets of examinafion
questions, with solutions to the exereises in mathematics. Dravn ng
in a useful and workmanlike fashion, the books give abundant pree
οἱ sound scholarship specialised and applied to the requiraments of
the London examinatione. speaking {rom the recollection of our
own undergraduate days, it is painfully evident that such worksas
these would have saved us many an hour’s hard and profltless grind.
We can unreservedly commend the series, believing that auch nids,
assesso? ms, xm
readers.’'

The Educ-anonae Journal, of the same date. servm—“These boob
save the student an immense labour. and. being from the pens oi
professional scholam, the information is not only correotly stated, but
easily understood.''
